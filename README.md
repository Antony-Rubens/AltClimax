Hackathon Track:Generative AI Hackathon for entertainment

Problem Statement:
Can we reimagine movie scenes by emotionally rewriting the climax or transforming the scene's mood using Generative AI, enhancing storytelling and accessibility for an unsatissfied movie ending giving a creative tool to the user/audience.

Solution:
An AI system that takes in movie scripts, detects a target scene, analyzes the emotion, and regenerates the climax or context (e.g., changing a sad ending to a happy one) using AI api 's other AI tools

Project Description:
Our project allows users to select a  movie and then it calls and goes into the url of imsdb and this is where the python library beautifullsoup scrapes data from imsdb to get the whole script structure.Then we take in the Gemini 2.5 pro api keys and asks it to analyze the script and then it breaks down into summary,characters and makes it easier to find a scene that doesn't suite their taste and then Gemini AI api does the  Google TTS for voice generation,  DALL¬∑E FOR IMAGE PROCESSING and changing their framerates to make it into a slideshow with voice and image in sync to bring in a smooth flow of presentation and better entertainmental view for audience  . The idea is to reimagine narratives, support creators, and even make content more accessible or culturally adaptive.
